# Machine Learning Models â€“ JV Cardio AI and CardioRisk Classifier

This repository contains machine learning modules developed during different phases of the heart disease prediction system project. The repository preserves both early prototype models and the final AI module used to build the complete JV Cardio AI system.

## JV CardioAI-MODEL.ipynb

This notebook contains the final and complete AI module used in the development of the JV Cardio AI system. It integrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction logic into one well-organized pipeline. This module represents the final phase of the project and was developed after thorough experimentation, optimization, and model validation.

It is intended for real-world deployment and demonstrates how the model can be applied in clinical or rural healthcare settings where early detection of heart disease is critical. The system supports accurate prediction of heart disease risk based on clinical input data and has been prepared for integration into a standalone application.

## project-cardio-risk-classifier-module (notebook/module)

This was an earlier prototype developed during a group project. It contains experimental work, model testing, and early concepts. It served as a foundation for testing different algorithms and understanding the problem space.

Although functional, this module was primarily used for research and feasibility testing. The lessons learned from this stage directly influenced the architecture and logic of the final JV Cardio AI system.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository documents the progression from prototype experimentation to a fully functional AI module. It serves both as a historical archive and a technical resource for anyone interested in the development of AI systems for medical diagnostics. It clearly separates the experimental phase from the production-ready model, giving insight into the evolution of the system.

Future improvements, deployment guides, and further optimizations will be included as the project continues.
